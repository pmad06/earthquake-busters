# Name 
Earthquake Risk Guide 
# Description 

Our web application is a tool that helps users learn more about earthquakes, either around their
location, or around the world. The relevant earthquake data is displayed on a map after the user either
inputs the magnitude or the location they are interested in searching. After inputting either a 
magnitude or location, the map zooms into the specific location and the earthquake location has a 
marker, which consists of a popup that includes information about the earthquake's location (city, state),
magnitude, and risk factor. The location and magnitude attributes were pulled directly from the USGS 
earthquakes dataset but the risk factor was manually calculated using the magnitude. Aside from the 
markers, other earthquake data is displayed on the side bar, which contains the earthquake's location, but
with the exact distance it was from a certain city, latitude/longitude, and a more info section which provides
an url to the USGS event page of the current earthquake displayed on the map. The url provides more in
depth information, such as regional information, the opportunity to report the users' experience, and nearby
seismiscity.
